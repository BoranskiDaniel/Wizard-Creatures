This is application for creatures in wizard world which is part of JS Back-End Module (SoftUni).
FUNCTIONALITY:
 The guest (not logged-in visitors) can view the home page and all posts page with available creatures. 
 They can also register with an email, first name, last name and password. After registering, they will be
 able to create their posts and voted to other's posts they are interested in (if the current user is not the author of the post).
 Authors can edit or delete posts at any time. And they can see all of their creatures in their profil page.
To create the application I used "express", "bcrypt", "mongoose", "jwt", "express-handlebars" and others.
